# Employee Assistance Chatbot

## Overview
This chatbot was developed during my internship at **Aramco's Advanced Research Center (ARC)**. It is specifically designed to assist ARC employees by answering questions related to **petroleum research** and **general life topics**. 

The chatbot serves as a user-friendly solution to streamline information retrieval and improve workplace productivity.

- **Chat History Storage**: Conversations are stored in a **Retool database**, enabling employees to revisit previous chats for reference.
- **Customizable UI**: The user interface was built using **Retool's Custom Components**, ensuring a smooth and efficient user experience.
